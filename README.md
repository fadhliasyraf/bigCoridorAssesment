## Hello reviewer. I just want to say a few words before you review my code. 

### This is my first project doing laravel. Im a beginner on it. My laravel skills is self taught. I hope regardless if i secure this position or not, you can review and point out what i did wrong in this code or where can i improve in this project. i would appreciate that so much. 

### My git skills are also beginner. I dont want to take full credit. I manage to push this project to my own git is due to guidance from a friend. But i did everything personally from the knowledge he shared from test the git clone to git push origin master. 

### I cannot spend more time for this project because I will be busy until sunday. This project took me around 15-20 hours to complete. Hopefully this meets the requirement. Do let me know if you encounter any issues. Thank you.
